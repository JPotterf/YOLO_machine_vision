# YOLO_machine_vision
YOLO algo machine vision example

Iâ€™ve been researching the YOLO algorithm for object/people detection. Read more here: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/


To run you will need to download the YOLO model weights yolov3.cfg (236 MB): https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

Then: python video.py in console 

The YOLO algorithm uses the COCO categories and training set included in the git and originally found here: http://cocodataset.org/#home

I've been using Ayoosh Kathuria's blog https://blog.paperspace.com/author/ayoosh/ as a reference point for MY own learning. 

Code for DNmodel.py, img_process.py, and util.py was all sourced from Ayoosh Kathuria. I referenced his image analysis to use for video applications While writing video.py

Thanks
